**This is a project taking csv and json data sets and creating graphs using matplotlib**

**Plot 1:** <br>
US Movies Produced by Year (1900-2018) <br>
<img src=Plot1.png> <br>
This is a bar graph plot that shows the total amount of US movies produced between 1900-2018. I got this data set from [this](https://github.com/jdorfman/awesome-json-datasets) site, which contains a ton of cool json datasets! This dataset contains a lot of data, such as the genre, year, cast, title, and much more. In terms of the data itself, I wanted to see if there was a trend over time in terms of movies produced - but I was unsure which way the trend would go. I was suprised that the most movies were produced between the last 1910's and the late 1950's, whith a large decrease between the 1960's until the mid-1980's. <br>

**Plot 2:** <br> 
Neflix Shows & US Movies Produced by Year (1990-2015) <br>
<img src=Plot2.png> <br>
This is a line graph plot that compares the amount of Netflix shows created versus the amount of US movies produced between 1990-2015. I chose to plot both of these data sets on one graph to see if there was a correlation between the two. The US movies data set, found [here](https://github.com/jdorfman/awesome-json-datasets) contains the year, genre, cast, title, and more. The Neflix shows data set, found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/netflix-shows?resource=download) has the cast, year, rating, duration, and more. This graph shows that there is at least a correlation between the amount of Netflix shows released versus the amount of US Movies produced, but I cannot draw any causations. I also would need to run a multi-regression analysis. It would be cool to revisit and update this graph once more data comes out on the more recent years, as COVID probably had a large impact on releases (not sure which, Movies or Netflix, would 'benifit' more, though). <br>
